# portfolio

## Description
In this portfolio I would like to display my best work, also to let people know why I choose to learn about Web Developtment. I am willing to learn how to build a good website from scracth, it will be long way to go for me, because I am just started doing computer and coding at the same time. With my basic knowledge of computer and coding, at least I can start to make a simple portfolio. I learn a lot from creating my first portfolio, especially about CSS and HTML. Unfortunately I don't have any web application to display, so I replace it with a placeholder image for 'project 1' and google slide for 'project 2'. For sure I will create my own web application in the future. In this simple portfolio, I try to make the presentation look propotional and the color matching. The about me section, I explain my current situation, also after 3 weeks doing course I start to enjoy doing coding.
